    During my time at Ostrovok I've learned what proper tech company should look like, how important company culture is and what Google-esqe values are. I've been mostly involved with programming web with python, but real thing was culture of course.

    Shopster was a logical continuation of my MAI diploma. Idea was that people get lost in malls and solution was to use ambient wireless signal to help them track their way indors. Another cool singal was ambient magnetic fields, and it made solution even more precise. Real world needed something else than just cool tech, so company pivoted to "Google Analytics for people counting" by tapping WiFi signals form their phones. The team was assembled and then funding raised. Then I was fired. Cool.
